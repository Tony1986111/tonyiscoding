# Todo App

A simple yet functional todo application built with React that uses localStorage for data persistence.

## Tech Stack

- React
- CSS
- LocalStorage API

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Filter tasks by status
- Data persistence using localStorage
- Responsive design

## Development Process

This was one of my first React projects. I built it to practice state management and learn how to use browser storage APIs.

## Challenges

The main challenges I faced were:
- Managing state across components
- Implementing the edit functionality
- Ensuring data persistence

## Lessons Learned

This project helped me understand React's component lifecycle and state management. I also learned how to use browser storage APIs for simple data persistence.
